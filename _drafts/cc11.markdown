title: C++11

I read Stroustrup's [FAQ post](http://www.stroustrup.com/C++11FAQ.html) for C++11.



Something to do with schools teaching C++11 over older versions. But are companies going to adopt the language soon
enough. I work for Cisco Systems and we are still on g++4.0 (or something like that).
