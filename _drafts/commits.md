Last week I read an article about [code commits](http://blog.osamasidat.com/dont-be-a-git).

Don't commit big changes is easier said than done.  To make it easier, don't shy away from trashing your big change.

If you have a pile of code to check in and no good way to split it into smaller commits, then start over.

Now that you've done it once you'll know where parts of the change can be broken down.

What was going to be one big ugly change is now four to five smaller logical changes.

And your code looks and works better too.


throwing away and starting a change over can work really well.

You'll do a better job of coding it up because you've already done it and know where to look out and such.

This article says the same thing, but with better words.
