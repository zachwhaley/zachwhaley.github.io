title: The Legend of Korra

This show is at the top of my list!

The show is exciting and funny, action packed.  But the thing that really sets it apart is how incredibly real it is.

How much real life is infused into the story.  The villians are complex and you can sympothise with their cause.

I'll have more on this later...
