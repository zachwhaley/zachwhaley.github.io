A while ago I wrote about [Emacs](http://zachwhaley.me/2014/03/04/emacs.html) and about how I
was going to switch to it.  Well I'm back to using Vim and I've found that I love this text
editor.

I discovered [tpope's](https://github.com/tpope) "secret" stash of plugins, along with
[vim-airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline) which introduced me to **__MORE__** cool
plugins!  I kind of went crazy and downloaded them all...

My Vim at work basically froze every time I would save a buffer, so that didn't last long.
I've started cherry picking my plugins and finding which ones I use and which I actually
understand; now I've got a
[decent set](https://github.com/zachwhaley/dotfiles/tree/master/vim.symlink/bundle) of useful
plugins to keep me happy.

Anyway, I'm super excited about [neovim](http://neovim.org/).  And if you use Vim, so should
you.  neovim is a project to make Vim betterer and has gotten a lot of attention.  It's going
to default [common settings](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/276), make plugins more
flexible, versatile, and faster, and make Vim prettier inside and out.  I am eagerly waiting
to alias vi to nvim.

I also discovered [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman) and his sweet
[dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles), which I had to have.

And I [do](https://github.com/zachwhaley/dotfiles).
