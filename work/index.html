<p>
I am a tinkerer and tool-maker, with a love for making things easy and intuitive.
I enjoy seeking out new languages and paradigms to learn.
And I am a proponent of the Agile methodology and have served, and enjoyed my role, as a Scrum Master.

  <div class='subtitle'>
    <a href='https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh/commit/ea7b4d4b2da60fe44019b1c0e298a202a3b211b7'>Updated Perforce completion</a>
  </div>
</header>
<p>
This was a major update to Zsh's Perforce completion script that added tab completion the 2016.1 release of Perforce's command line tool.
</p>

<header>
  <a href='https://brew.sh/'><h2>Homebrew</h2></a>
  <div class='subtitle'>
    <a href='https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1615'>Add a method for installing fish function files</a>
  </div>
</header>
<p>
Fish shell allows third-party software vendors to put their own function files in a directory for their software.
For brew installed Fish shell, this is /usr/local/share/fish/vendor_functions.d
</p>

<header>
  <div class='subtitle'>
    <a href='https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1616'>Differentiate zsh completion files and function files</a>
  </div>
</header>
<p>
When installing a file to zsh/site-functions directory, it is assumed this is a zsh completion file, and the zsh completion caveat is printed after installation.
<br>
But not all files in the zsh/site-functions directory are completion files.
Some are files for functions that can be loaded on demand with zsh's autoload command.
