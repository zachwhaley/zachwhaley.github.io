<p>
I am a tinkerer and tool-maker, with a love for making things easy and intuitive.  I've spent the majority of my short career in C++ development, but I enjoy seeking out new languages and paradigms to play with.  I am also a proponent of the Agile methodology and have served, and enjoyed my role, as a Scrum Master.
