  </div>

    <a href='https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1616'>Differentiate zsh completion files and function files</a>
  </div>
</header>
<p>
When installing a file to zsh/site-functions directory, it is assumed this is a zsh completion file, and the zsh completion caveat is printed after installation.
<br>
But not all files in the zsh/site-functions directory are completion files.
Some are files for functions that can be loaded on demand with zsh's autoload command.

  <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
  <div class='subtitle'>
    <a href='http://www.cisco.com/'>Cisco Systems, Austin, TX (2013 - Present)</a>
  </div>
</header>
<p>
Worked in an Agile team on User Identification, Authentication, and Authorization in Cisco‚Äôs Next Generation Firewall products.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Developed software to synchronize with LDAP and Active Directory services, and perform authentication of users via mechanisms such as Basic Auth, NTLM, and Kerberos, as well as implementing traffic authorization based on IP mapped user identities.
</li>
<li>
Created a library to perform Kerberos Authentication.  This library was incorporated into the official product, replacing a faulty third party library, which saved the company a large sum of money in licensing.
</li>
<li>
Prototyped a rewrite of the product‚Äôs C/C++ build code using CMake, which yielded a build speed of 5 times faster, reduced inter-module dependencies, and decreased the complexity of module‚Äôs individual build files.
</li>
<li>
Constructed a temporary CI/CD pipeline for my team using Jenkins and Bitbucket.  This pipeline synchronized the main CVS repository to a private Git repository, utilized automated builds/tests from Jenkins, and the GitFlow workflow,  which isolated my team from frequent build failures during a high priority release.
</li>
</ul>
