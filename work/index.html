<p>
Worked on User Identification, Authentication, and Authorization in Cisco‚Äôs Next Generation Firewall products.

<ul>
<li>
Developed software to synchronize with LDAP and Active Directory services, and perform authentication of users via mechanisms such as Basic Auth, NTLM, and Kerberos, as well as implementing traffic authorization based on IP mapped user identities.
</li>
<li>
Created a library to perform Kerberos Authentication.  This library was incorporated into the official product, replacing a faulty third party library, which saved the company a large sum of money in licensing.
</li>
<li>
Prototyped a rewrite of the product‚Äôs C/C++ build code using CMake, which yielded a build speed of 5 times faster, reduced inter-module dependencies, and decreased the complexity of module‚Äôs individual build files.
</li>
<li>
Constructed a temporary CI/CD pipeline for my team using Jenkins and Bitbucket.  This pipeline synchronized the main CVS repository to a private Git repository, utilized automated builds/tests from Jenkins, and the GitFlow workflow,  which isolated my team from frequent build failures during a high priority release.
